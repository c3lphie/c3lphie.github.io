* Whoami
I'm a 21, soon to be 22, year old danish tech nerd that loves hacking, programming and all things tech!
I study computer engineering, and plan on specializing in the security field.
I don't have any certifications yet, but I do have the PTSv4 course from eLearnsecurity which i just need to finish.
I don't plan being too personal on this blog, so enough about who I am.
* WTF is this
That is a great question!
This is my little spot on the internet where I can upload and share things I interesting.
It will most likely contain write-ups for [[https://hackthebox.eu][HackTheBox]], [[https://tryhackme.com][TryHackMe]] or other CTF's I join([[https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf][Wtf is a CTF]]).

I might also blog about my linux dotfiles, or other cool things I might bump into.
Who knows what the future brings ;)

So yeah hope that you will stick around, even though the place is kinda empty at the moment.
