If you like what I do feel free to donate!
This is the only way to support me, as I don't serve ads, and never will given how privacy intrusive different solutions are today.

You can donate to the following crypto assets:
 - Bitcoin (BTC)  :: ~bc1qdge67ckelaa7uwnpmat2sxx389f37k789eqst8~
 - Ethereum (ETH) :: ~0x2F19f73724D4bbcbc1C6F28F28B8cbA254139263~
 - Monero (XMR)   :: ~8771huUuGkuFFMkNX4YiFSR9f1qyXzbV6STBbZ6ac7wbNhx8UFYxyHRWgnEU7WUaxbZFvLwEZ9k7hL8QYRXTh9eVUagijNw~
   
If it is not in your budget to handout crypto coins left and right, just spread the word and share my site to whomever you think might be interested.

* Transparency
Now I'm not gonna tell why you should donate, as that is completly your decision.

What I'll tell instead is what your money is going to be used on (more or less atleast):
 - Incentive to keep writing posts
 - Renewal of domain name
 - Coffee (and/or beer depending on time and day of week)
 - My internet subscription
 - Food

As you can see I'm not running a business using this site, but I'm more than grateful for any and all donations.
